# Problem Statement: Building a Streamlit Application for Gemini Q&A without history

## Background
You are tasked with creating a Streamlit application that leverages the Google Generative AI model (Gemini) to provide responses to user-inputted questions. The Gemini model is capable of generating textual content based on the given input.

## Task
Your goal is to develop a user-friendly Streamlit application that allows users to input questions and receive responses generated by the Gemini model.

## Steps

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Make sure to have Python installed on your machine.
   - Create a requirements.txt file and add the following dependencies in the list 
        - streamlit
        - google-generativeai
        - python-dotenv
   - Install the necessary Python packages using the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **API Key Configuration:**
   - Obtain a Google API key and set it as an environment variable. You can use a `.env` file to store your key.
   - Ensure that the Google API key is accessible using the `os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")` command.

3. **Gemini Model Configuration:**
   - Configure the Gemini model with the provided Google API key using `genai.configure(api_key=os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY"))`.

4. **Streamlit App Initialization:**
   - Initialize the Streamlit app with a page title and header using `st.set_page_config()` and `st.header()`.

5. **User Input Interface:**
   - Create a text input box in the Streamlit app to allow users to input their questions. Use `st.text_input()` and provide a key for tracking changes.

6. **Generate Button:**
   - Add a button (e.g., "Generate") to trigger the question generation process. Use `st.button()` to create the button.

7. **Question Generation Function:**
   - Implement the `get_gemini_response(question)` function to interact with the Gemini model and obtain responses based on the user's question.

8. **Display Response:**
   - If the "Generate" button is clicked, call the `get_gemini_response()` function with the user input and display the generated response using `st.subheader()` and `st.write()`.

9. **Markdown Formatting:**
   - Implement a function (`to_markdown()`) to convert the generated response to Markdown format for better presentation.

10. **Run the Application:**
    - Run the Streamlit application locally using the command:
      ```bash
      streamlit run app.py
      ```
11. **Test the Application:**
    - Test the application by entering different questions and checking the corresponding responses generated by the Gemini model.
