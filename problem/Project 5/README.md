# Problem Statement: ATS Resume Expert Streamlit Application

## Background
You are tasked with building a Streamlit application named "ATS Resume Expert" that leverages the Google Generative AI model (Gemini) for analyzing resumes against job descriptions. The application should allow users to upload a resume in PDF format, input a job description, and receive responses from Gemini regarding the resume evaluation and percentage match.

## Steps

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
   - Install the required Python packages using the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install streamlit google-generativeai pdf2image pillow
     ```

2. **API Key Configuration:**
   - Acquire a Google API key and set it as an environment variable, preferably in a `.env` file.
   - Confirm that the Google API key is accessible using the `os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")` command.

3. **Gemini Model Configuration:**
   - Configure the Gemini model with the provided Google API key using `genai.configure(api_key=os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY"))`.

4. **Streamlit App Initialization:**
   - Initialize the Streamlit app with a title and header using `st.set_page_config()` and `st.header()`.

5. **User Input Interface:**
   - Create a text area for users to input the job description using `st.text_area()`.

6. **Resume Upload Interface:**
   - Allow users to upload a resume in PDF format using `st.file_uploader()`.

7. **Tell Me About the Resume Button:**
   - Implement a button (e.g., "Tell Me About the Resume") to trigger Gemini for generating responses related to the resume and job description alignment.

8. **Percentage Match Button:**
   - Implement a button (e.g., "Percentage Match") to trigger Gemini for generating responses related to the percentage match between the resume and job description.

9. **PDF to Image Conversion:**
   - Convert the uploaded PDF resume to an image using `pdf2image.convert_from_bytes()`.

10. **Base64 Conversion:**
    - Convert the first page of the PDF resume to base64 format for Gemini input.

11. **Gemini Response Function:**
    - Create the function `get_gemini_response(input, pdf_content, prompt)` to interact with the Gemini model and obtain responses based on the provided inputs.

12. **Display Response:**
    - Display the generated response in the Streamlit app using `st.subheader()` and `st.write()`.

13. **Run the Application:**
    - Run the Streamlit application locally using the command:
      ```bash
      streamlit run your_script_name.py
      ```
      Replace `your_script_name.py` with the name of your Python script containing the provided code.

14. **Test the Application:**
    - Test the application by uploading a PDF resume, inputting a job description, and observing the responses generated by the Gemini model for both resume evaluation and percentage match.
