# Problem Statement: Building a Streamlit Application for Conversational PDF Analysis with Gemini

## Background
Your task is to develop a Streamlit application that utilizes the Google Generative AI model (Gemini) for conversational analysis of PDF documents. The application should allow users to upload PDF files, input questions related to the content, and receive detailed responses generated by the Gemini model.

## Steps

- Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
   - Make sure to have Python installed on your machine.
   - Create a requirements.txt file and add the following dependencies in the list 
        - streamlit
        - google-generativeai
        - python-dotenv
        - langchain
        - PyPDF2
        - chromadb
        - faiss-cpu
        - langchain_google_genai
   - Install the necessary Python packages using the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   

2. **API Key Configuration:**
   - Acquire a Google API key and set it as an environment variable, preferably in a `.env` file.
   - Confirm that the Google API key is accessible using the `os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")` command.

3. **Gemini Model Configuration:**
   - Configure the Gemini model with the provided Google API key using `genai.configure(api_key=os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY"))`.

4. **Streamlit App Initialization:**
   - Initialize the Streamlit app with a title and header using `st.set_page_config()` and `st.header()`.

5. **PDF Text Extraction:**
   - Implement a function (`get_pdf_text`) to extract text from the uploaded PDF files using `PyPDF2.PdfReader`.

6. **Text Chunking:**
   - Use the `langchain.text_splitter` module to split the extracted text into chunks for efficient processing.

7. **Vector Store Generation:**
   - Utilize Google Generative AI embeddings to create a vector store (`FAISS`) from the text chunks.

8. **Conversational Chain Setup:**
   - Set up a conversational chain using the Gemini model and a template prompt for question answering.

9. **User Input Interface:**
   - Create a text input box for users to input questions related to the PDF content using `st.text_input()`.

10. **PDF Upload Interface:**
    - Allow users to upload multiple PDF files using `st.file_uploader()` in the sidebar. Use a button to trigger processing.

11. **PDF Processing Button:**
    - Implement a button (e.g., "Submit & Process") to trigger the processing of uploaded PDFs and vector store generation.

12. **User Input Processing:**
    - Upon user input, use the conversational chain and the generated vector store to find relevant documents and generate responses.

13. **Display Response:**
    - Display the generated response in the Streamlit app using `st.write()`.

14. **Run the Application:**
    - Run the Streamlit application locally using the command:
      ```bash
      streamlit run app.py
      ```

15. **Test the Application:**
    - Test the application by uploading PDF files, asking questions, and observing the responses generated by the Gemini model.
