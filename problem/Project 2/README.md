# Problem Statement: Building a Streamlit Application for Gemini Image Description

## Background
In this project, you are tasked with developing a Streamlit application that utilizes the Google Generative AI model (Gemini) to provide descriptive responses about images. The Gemini model is specifically designed for image-related content generation.

## Task
Your objective is to create an interactive Streamlit application that allows users to input prompts and upload images, receiving detailed responses about the content of the uploaded images from the Gemini model.

## Steps

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
   - Make sure to have Python installed on your machine.
   - Create a requirements.txt file and add the following dependencies in the list 
        - streamlit
        - google-generativeai
        - python-dotenv
   - Install the necessary Python packages using the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **API Key Configuration:**
   - Acquire a Google API key and set it as an environment variable, preferably in a `.env` file.
   - Confirm that the Google API key is accessible using the `os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")` command.

3. **Gemini Model Configuration:**
   - Configure the Gemini model with the provided Google API key using `genai.configure(api_key=os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY"))`.

4. **Streamlit App Initialization:**
   - Initialize the Streamlit app with a page title and header using `st.set_page_config()` and `st.header()`.

5. **User Input Interface:**
   - Create a text input box for user prompts using `st.text_input()` and provide a key for tracking changes.

6. **Image Uploading:**
   - Allow users to upload images using `st.file_uploader()` with support for file types like JPG, JPEG, and PNG.

7. **Image Display:**
   - Display the uploaded image using `st.image()` with an appropriate caption and column width.

8. **Question and Image Submission:**
   - Implement a button (e.g., "Tell me about the image") to trigger the Gemini model with the input prompt and uploaded image.

9. **Gemini Response Function:**
   - Create the function `get_gemini_response(input, image)` to interact with the Gemini model, considering cases where the input prompt may be empty.

10. **Display Response:**
    - If the submission button is clicked, call the `get_gemini_response()` function, and display the generated response using `st.subheader()` and `st.write()`.

11. **Run the Application:**
    - Run the Streamlit application locally using the command:
      ```bash
      streamlit run app.py
      ```

12. **Test the Application:**
    - Test the application by entering different prompts and uploading various images to observe the responses generated by the Gemini model.
